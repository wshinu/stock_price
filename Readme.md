# Stock price prediction

Overview
This project is focused on predicting stock prices using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model. The LSTM model is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) that is well-suited for sequence prediction tasks, such as stock price forecasting.

The project consists of two main components:

LSTM Model Training: In this part, historical stock price data is used to train the LSTM model. The model is trained to learn patterns and dependencies in the data, enabling it to make predictions on unseen stock price data.

Web App with Panel: The trained LSTM model is deployed as a web application using the Panel library. The web app allows users to input a stock symbol and obtain a predicted stock price for the next day based on the trained model.

Key Features
Stock price prediction using LSTM model
Web app interface for easy interaction
Real-time prediction for the next day's stock price
Visualization of predicted and real stock prices
Installation
To run the project locally, please follow these steps:

Clone the repository:

git clone <repository-url>
Install the required dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt
Start the web app:
Copy code
python app.py
Access the web app in your browser at http://localhost:5000.
Usage
Open the web app in your browser.

Enter the stock symbol for which you want to predict the stock price.

Click the "Predict" button to obtain the predicted stock price for the next day.

The predicted stock price will be displayed on the web app along with a line graph comparing the predicted and real stock prices.

Data
The stock price data used for training and prediction is sourced from <yahoofinance>. It consists of historical stock price information including the date, open price, high price, low price, close price, and volume.

Model
The LSTM model used for stock price prediction is trained on historical stock price data. It takes a sequence of past stock prices as input and predicts the next day's stock price. The model architecture includes LSTM layers, dropout regularization, and a dense output layer.

The trained model is saved in the file "lstm_model.h5" and is loaded by the web app for making predictions.
